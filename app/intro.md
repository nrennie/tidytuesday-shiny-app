#TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge aimed at the R community. Every week a new dataset is posted alongside a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask participants explore the data. You can access the data and find out more on [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md).

My contributions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday), and you can use this Shiny app to explore my visualisations with links to code for each individual plot. You can also follow my attempts on Mastodon at [fosstodon.org/@nrennie](https://fosstodon.org/@nrennie).
